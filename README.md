# Scoreclub Project Development Workspace

This workspace is organized for:
- **Main development** in `main_project/`
- **Individual day-wise contributions** in `day_01/person_1/`, `day_01/person_2/`, `day_01/person_3/`

## Day 1 Goal
Set up project structure, ownership, and initial planning artifacts so all three members can make visible GitHub commits.
